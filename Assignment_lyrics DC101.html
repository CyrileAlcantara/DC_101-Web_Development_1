    Lyrics 

</h2>

<p style="text-align: center;">
       What is this i'm feelin' <br>
       I just can't explain when you're near <br>
       I'm not just the same i try to hide it <br>
       Try not to show it it's crazy <br>
       It could'nt be 
</p>
       
<p style="text-align: center;">
       I've fallen for you <br>
       Finally, my heart gave in <br>
       And i'm fallen in love i fin'lly know <br>
       How it feels
</p>
       
<p style="text-align: center;">
       When you said hello i look in your eyes <br>
       Suddenly, I felt good inside <br>
       Is this really happ'nin? <br>
       Or am I just dreaming? I guess, it's true <br>
       I can't believe
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
       I've fallen for you <br>
       Finally, my heart gave in <br>
       And I'm fallen in love <br>
       I fin'lly know how it feels so this is love <br>
       Doesn't matter where I am <br>
       Thoughts of you still linger in my mind <br>
       No matter what time of day <br>
       I've really, really fallen for you
</p>
       
<p style="text-align: center;">
       I've fallen for youFinally, my heart gave in <br>
       And I'm fallen in love <br>
       I fin'lly know how it feels so this is love <br>
</p>
